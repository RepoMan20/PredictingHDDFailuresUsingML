# Predicting HDD Failures Using ML
## Using Machine Learning and Data Science techniques to help predict failure of Hard Disk Drives

In today's digital era, we often find ourselves storing all important information on our devices such as PCs, Laptops etc..  

Imagine this,

You start your PC, and suddenly, a bad sector error pops up out of the blue.... Or even worse... 
## No bootable device found!..

 You panic as all your personal information like your imp mails,photos and what not...are just.... GONE!

What do you do?
You do another restart as one would normally do... and HEY!
Your PC booted up fine... Only this time you have to be very careful and transfer all your data somewhere else...
You somehow manage to do that successfully.. then what next?

You probably want to know whether your HDD is giving up right?
Well there are lots of ways to check whether your HDD is healthy or not....But me being a IT student, wanted to do something more ... ;)

 SMART Attributes are used to check the condition of your HDD and provide you with a result..i.e
 Healthy or Likely to Fail...
  But in this scenario, it is only one HDD 
 Imagine Datacenters,Datawarehouses etc where so many HDDs are used and people just don't have time to check each and every HDD for its health right?
 
 So, i applied my Data Science and Machine Learning knowledge to help predict whether a HDD is likely to fail or not, given a dataset of hard drives....
 
I thought this would make it easy to check the health of multiple HDDs at once?? Cool right? {only Admins know the pain :( }

So i built a Random Forest Model using the dataset available on Kaggle :https://www.kaggle.com/jackywangkaggle/hard-drive-data-and-stats

Thoughts on this model are welcome! And big thanks to the Open Source Community & Kaggle! 

P.S : This project was based on my real life experience!
